There
are
a

decent
people
working
there
,
but
the
rest
are
VERY
dishonest

as

as
rude
,
I
have
yet
to
hear
the
truth
come
out

Give
them
a
try

The
pizzas
are
huge

super
delicious
.
They
're
our
favorite
pizza
place
to
order
from
...
and
they
're
a

company
!
How
much
better
does
it
get
?!
I
loved
the
atmosphere
here
and
the
food
is
good
,
however
the
tables
are
so
close
together
that
it
feels
very
cramped
.
We
were
made
to
feel
very
welcome
.
Well

Chuck
and

were
very

,
and
when
Alan
's

to
work
on

,
Chuck
came
right
out
and
saw
the
problem
and
did
what
Alan
's

would

do

worked

mins

paying
a

had

but
with
my
DUI
and
Sr
-

they
were
able
to
get
me
the
best
deal
out
there
.
Is
not

office
This
is
a
delivery
office
only
and
does
not

ins

they
do
have
a

box
out
front

Glad
I
called
before
I
arrived
with
my
box
to
ship
.
Thought
adding
a
comment
would
save
someone
the
hassle
with
a
useless
trip
there
.
the
food
is
mediocre
at
best
.
the
waitress
took
my
name
and
then
called
me
that
all
night
.
not
sure
how
I
feel
about
that
one
.
it
's
passable
as
a
pub
,
but
the
pizza
is
not
that
great
.
if
you
want
good
pizza
,
go
to
famoso
.
seriously
.
Anyone
else
find
it
a
little
suspicious
that
there
are
not
only
20
reviews
for
this
dentist
(
a
HUGE
number
compared
to
the
others
in
the
area
)
,
but
that
they
all
have
the
same
unique
grammar
structure
?
And
they
seem
to
be
posted
at
fairly
regular
intervals
?
Best

Harlan
provides
great
service
.
He
is
very
knowledgeable
and
took
the
time
to
explain
the
repairs
to
me
.
The
work
on
my
car
was
done
quickly
and
I
felt
I
could
trust
his
work
.
I
have
nothing
but
fantastic
things
to
say
.
I
highly
recommend
his
shop
.
Best
in
Memphis
This
shop
is
by
far
the
best
I
have
been
to
.
I
have
a
Saab
...
which
everything
is
expensive
on
and
they
have
been
extrememly
fair
and
price
a
lot
lower
than
any
other
shop
I
called
.
They
are
the
only
place
I
would
take
my
car
peiod
.
Took
a
laptop
in
for
a
video
cable
to
be
replaced
.
Everything
except
the
display
worked
fine
before
I
took
it
in
.
The
video
cable
was
replaced
and
suddenly
the
motherboard
was
dead
.
Phone
calls
were
n't
returned
when
promised
and
the
botched
repair
took
a
week
longer
than
promised
.
We
have
stayed
at
Tanglewood
for
many
years
now
.
We
go
over
about
5
times
a
year
.
We
have
never
had
a
problem
with
the
cabins
.
They
are
always
so
helpful
.
The
cabins
have
always
been
clean
.
Helen
is
a
wonderful
place
to
take
you
family
.
We
recommend
these
cabins
!
Ca
n't
say
enough
I
used
to
tan
down
the
street
before
I
was
referred
to
this
place
by
one
of
my
friends
.
WOW
!
I
did
n't
know
what
I
was
missing
.
The
lowest
bed
here
is
better
than
my
last
salon
s
highest
level
.
Salon
is
clean
and
girls
are
nice
.
Great
People
and
even
better
service
!
Best
to
deal
with
!
In
a
few
words
...
I
'm
pleasantly
surprised
that
you
can
still
find
"
old
school
"
service
out
there
where
company
care
more
about
good
name
and
customers
than
their
pockets
...
Highly
recommended
people
/
business
.
Thanks

Dentist
you
can
trust
If
possible
I
try
the
services
on
myself
before
I
bring
in
my
son
.
Drs.
Ali
work
wonders
.
Neither
me
nor
my
son
have
n't
had
a
single
cavity
since
we
started
dental
care
there
.
The
team
focus
is
prevention
and
education
.
That
alone
makes
them
unique
.
This
is
not
your
usual
cheap
hotdog
place
.
They
offer
a
large
variety
of
quality
hotdogs
and
hamburgers
They
also
offer
veggie
dogs
.
The
fries
are
of
good
quality
,
the
staff
is
friendly
.
The
atmosphere
is
your
typical
indie
outfit
with
old
movie
posters
and
memorabilia
from
the
70's
and
80's
.
Over
charged
.
I
used
my
card
to
purchase
a
meal
on
the
menu
and
the
total
on
my
receipt
was
$
8.95
but
when
I
went
on
line
to
check
my
transaction
it
show
$
10.74
.
There
is
something
wrong
or
maybe
the
individual
made
a
mistake
but
to
me
that
is
not
integrity
.
Elmira
,
you
r
the
best
!
All
I
can
say
is
that
Elmira
you
are
the
best
I
ve
experienced
,
never
before
has
the
seamstress
done
a
perfect
job
until
i
met
you
.
I
recommend
you
to
everyone
in
Calgary
,
as
she
is
a
professional
and
the
cost
for
her
was
low
.
